# Handwritten-Digit-Recognition-using-CNN-with-GUI-user-input
In this project a graphical user interface allowed users to draw handwritten digits and had them recognized using a CNN model. The popular MNIST dataset is used, which consists of grayscale images of handwritten digits, multiple CNN models are implemented using Keras and GUI is implemented using the Tkinter library.
